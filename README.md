- [x] ABS: Replaces a variable by its negation.

- [x] OBBN: Replaces the operators & by | and vice versa.

- [x] AOD: Replaces an arithmetic expression by one of the operand. 

- [x] ROR: Replaces the relational operators with another one. It applies every replacement. 

- [x] AOR: Replaces an arithmetic expression by another one.

- [x] UOI: Replaces a variable with a unary operator or removes an instance of an unary operator.
