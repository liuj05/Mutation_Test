# Mutation_Test
Goals:
a. ABS: Replaces a variable by its negation, e.g., a Þ −a
b. OBBN: Replaces the operators & by | and vice versa, e.g., a&b Þ a|b
c. AOD: Replaces an arithmetic expression by one of the operand, e.g., a
+ b Þ a
d. ROR: Replaces the relational operators with another one. It applies
every replacement, e.g., < Þ ≥, or > Þ ≤
e. AOR: Replaces an arithmetic expression by another one. a + b Þ a ∗ b
f. UOI: Replaces a variable with a unary operator or removes an
instance of an unary operator. a Þ a++
g. CRCR: Replaces a constant a with its negation, or with 1, 0, a + 1, a – 1,
e.g., aÞ −a, and a Þ a − 1.
